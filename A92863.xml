         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>YOU drive furiouſly</hi> over the necks of King and Parliament, Lawes, Covenants, Loyalty, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and no humane thing can ſtand before you: You are now fac'd by the majeſty and light of God, while you are aſleep in a dark night of earthly affaires: You have appealed to God in your ſecond Declaration, but did not expect ſo ſudden an anſwer: 'Tis eternall and almighty truth that muſt and will prevaile; if you come into it, 'twill ſave you; if you turne from it, you forſake your <hi>own mercy;</hi> if you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, you daſh your ſelves in pieces; you cannot go from it, or beſides it, but into the darkneſſe of hell: The Lord is here <hi>obbraiding your unbeliefe, but mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over his Jeruſalem;</hi> with love to your perſons, but with fierce anger againſt your practiſes: I would you had thoſe lively and freſh evidences of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall and everlaſting good in your owne breaſts, as I have; your eternall ſtate is ſure; 'tis your preſent wandrings that are here condemned; <hi>Blindneſſe hath happened to you in part;</hi> and this is <hi>the time of caſting you away;</hi> you will have a time of <hi>being received</hi> againe; you are <hi>now broken off through unbeliefe, you will be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in againe:</hi> 'Tis your <hi>falt</hi> now, you ſhall have a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring;</hi> you will wonder to behold ſo much <hi>goodneſſe</hi> to your enemies, and ſo much <hi>ſeverity</hi> to you. <hi>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his judgements and his wayes

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn, overturn, overturn; 'tis Scripture ſtill, and that word lives in and upon you. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his meſſage quickly followed it, <hi>Depart from the tents of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous men,</hi> he lives ſtill: And Mr. <hi>Pinnels</hi> Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition from the Lord following that: Theſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimonies againſt you, have been ſleighted and diſobeyed; your ſinnes grow greater, and the anger of God hotter againſt you; your reprieve is not your ſalvation; you are growne to a height of confidence and preſumption upon your ſucceſſes; <hi>your necks are as iron, and your browes braſſe;</hi> and you walke uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable in your way, triumphing as the onely Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the earth, as ſit to ſway the Scepter of <hi>England,</hi> and all nations; as the onely righteous, honourable people in the world; the great Lords of the Land: Therefore it pleaſes me to <hi>powre contempt upon you,</hi> to be ſhod with ſcorne and indignation, and <hi>ſo trample upon Princes as morter.</hi> Except I ſhould deale thus with you, you would not be ſenſible of what I ſay, being hardned againſt mercy; and having done all you have done againſt love; <hi>Proſperity ſlayes fooles, and therefore the rod is fit for their backs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know my dealing is juſt and righteous to ſuch as you are, being (as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19.) <hi>Enemies to the Croſſe
<pb facs="tcp:164832:3"/>of Chriſt;</hi> ſeeming friends to his Goſpell, Miniſtry, and Kingdome, but enemies to his <hi>Croſſe:</hi> You hate to thinke that thoſe faire <hi>beginnings</hi> of your peace and deliverance, ſhould come to end in ſhame and death; you cannot thinke of leaving your hopes of outward <hi>glory,</hi> and lying downe quietly, to let the world tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon you: This you count folly, <hi>whoſe end is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:</hi> Deſtruction you practiſe, 'tis your worke, 'tis your end, you cannot ſee beyond it, and you are haſtening to it, it is the center to which you tend; and therefore I cannot but ſhew it you, that you may ſtop your courſe before the <hi>pit ſhut her mouth upon you: whoſe God is their belly;</hi> Your faith, underſtanding &amp; God, is ſunke into your bellies, and your rule, your ſtrength, your confidence is only in ſenſuall and bruitiſh things; your raiſed ſpirits into the <hi>things of God</hi> are buried in an inferiour <hi>region</hi> of groſſe, dull, carnall affaires, and except I ſhould pierce deep, your <hi>ſlow bellies</hi> would not find eares: Indeed you are ſo loſt and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſenſible things of the world, and ſo <hi>eager</hi> in <hi>ſeeking</hi> for thoſe things your belly, your carnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons require of you, that I doubt you will be deafe to what I ſay. <hi>Whoſe glory is in their ſhame;</hi> you are full of <hi>glory</hi> in your <hi>great things</hi> that you have done; <hi>wonderful things, a mighty preſence of God.</hi> But in ſum, what is it? You have torne a poore, ſinfull <hi>Kingdome</hi> in peices; You have executed wrath upon your Brethren, Friends and Country-men; You have laid deſolate your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King, the Parliament your Mother, your own Country; this is your glory to be executioners; <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria the rod of my anger:</hi> What a crowne is this? Have you reſtored, bleſſed, healed, comforted, ſaved any?
<pb facs="tcp:164832:4"/>No, you have but plunged the Kingdome and your ſelves into a pit of darkneſſe and confuſion: When the things of God are propoſed to you, to ſuffer for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to love enemies, to do good to all, to bleſſe all; <hi>you glory in your ſhame,</hi> and ſay, you <hi>ſerve the Lord in this,</hi> and there be <hi>lower</hi> as well as higher diſpenſations: You are indeed ſervants of God, ſo was <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> ſo is the Devill; and you do the work of <hi>God,</hi> but 'tis baſe drudgery, 'tis <hi>his ſtrange work,</hi> to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his vengeance; and <hi>tis a lower diſpenſation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to diſpenſe curſes, not bleſſings, to be <hi>below</hi> in hell, exercis'd in the wrath of God; not above in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the glory and love of God; and for ſons, heires, ſo you would be thought, to take pleaſure in ſuch mean employment, is vile and unworthy: <hi>Who mind earthly things;</hi> this is another property of yours, your minds are now captiv'd to the earth, deep in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of the earth, pleading the earthly cauſe of earthly people, or digging caves and holes in the earth to ſecure an earthly peace to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>'Its high time to withſtand you, and to <hi>rebuke this deſtroying Angel;</hi> for 'tis not men only that ſuffer from your violence, but the Lord; your ſword goe ſo deep, <hi>That it peirces thorow his ſoule alſo:</hi> You are gone ſo far in <hi>diſſolving the foundations of government,</hi> that you are come to him that upholds the <hi>pillars of the earth:</hi> You reach to the <hi>head of principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> to the Lord who is the author and upholder of all theſe things; he is in theſe poore, broken and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ordinances of his, and ſenſible of every blow that is given to them: <hi>You have digged thorow the wall</hi> of fleſh and men, and broke downe that <hi>partition wall that</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:164832:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>divided them from God; and now you are in the bowels of the Lord, theſe miſerable, broken powers are now the Lord: Go on to teare and rend, you <hi>will at laſt look upon him whom you have peirced, and mourne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King and Parliament cry unto God in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, ſaying, <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our Father, though A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham be ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknowledge us not, Thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer.</hi> Though you in the greatneſſe of your faith, and confidence in your priviledges, as high as <hi>Abraham and Iſrael</hi> in your lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forme, doe not know them, yet the Lord ownes them, and will hear their cry and deliver them.</p>
            <p>Your proceedings are againſt the Lord; and though you ſay theſe things you doe muſt be done till Chriſt come; and when he comes, then 'tis true, there will need none of theſe things to ſecure your ſelves, but as yet <hi>you must act as men:</hi> In this, you ſay, <hi>your Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies his coming,</hi> and ſo <hi>drunk</hi> with your proſperity and victories, <hi>you beat your fellow ſervants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here you will finde your Lord in an <hi>houre that you were not aware of:</hi> You ſay he will come and deſtroy you and your waies in time, but he is already upon you, and you are not <hi>aware</hi> of it, <hi>and cuts you aſunder;</hi> opens your inward parts, divides the ſecrets of your hearts, and <hi>appoints you a portion with hypocrites and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth:</hi> You act againſt God, and God againſt you; <hi>Your ſoules loath him, his ſoule loathes you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Heres nothing written but what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in your hearts; 'tis the opening your owne ſoules; 'tis but what you have fear'd, and that puniſhment which your owne humiliations and confeſſions have
<pb facs="tcp:164832:5"/>acknowledged juſt and due to you: Nothing but what I have ſuffered for acting in thoſe waies in which you are; <hi>What meaſure hath been meaſured to me by God, that doe I meaſure to you:</hi> And as I lay it on you, ſo I ſuffer it with you, and ſhall be content to ſuffer till you are reſtored from this condition of ſhame and wrath, to honour and love, and ſo dwell with you in theſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings, which will purifie you from all your filth.</p>
